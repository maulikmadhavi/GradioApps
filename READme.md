# Introduction

Welcome to the Gradio Demo Project! This project showcases a simple yet powerful demonstration of using Gradio to create interactive web interfaces for machine learning models and data processing scripts. 

In this project, we have implemented a tax calculator using Gradio and Pandas. The calculator takes an income input, computes the tax, and updates a dataframe with the income and tax values. The interactive interface allows users to input their income and see the calculated tax in real-time.

Feel free to explore the code and see how Gradio can be used to build intuitive and interactive web applications with minimal effort.
